Hello! I'm Ercan Öz, a passionate data analyst currently working at TEB | BNP Paribas. With a strong background in statistical modeling, data visualization, and forecasting, I specialize in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on various impactful projects across different sectors. My recent work includes developing sales and market share forecasts for İpragaz A.Ş. | SHV in the energy sector, where I utilized real-world data from EPDK to create dynamic dashboards that aid in strategic decision-making.
I am continuously developing my skills in data science and analytics, driven by a desire to stay at the forefront of the field and deliver even greater value through data-driven business solutions. I am also transitioning into the field of SAP, aiming to merge my analytical expertise with SAP technologies.

When I'm not deep in data, I enjoy exploring new technologies, gaming, and constantly learning to enhance my professional growth.
